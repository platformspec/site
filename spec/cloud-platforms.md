# Cloud Platforms

## Definition
A "Cloud Platform" refers to a comprehensive set of cloud-based services, tools, and infrastructure that allows organizations to develop, deploy, manage, and scale applications and services in the cloud. It provides a foundational environment that abstracts much of the complexity of managing physical hardware, networking, and data centers, enabling users to focus on building and running their applications.

A "Cloud Platform" is essentially the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, providing the tools, services, and resources necessary to develop, deploy, and manage applications in a scalable, flexible, and efficient manner. It abstracts the complexities of traditional IT management, enabling organizations to focus on innovation, agility, and delivering value to their customers.

Quickly and often "Cloud Platforms" become quite intricate and complicated as the organization expands its software based services.


## Key Components of a Cloud Platform
A cloud platform can be broken down into six distinct component groups.  The below sections capture the six key components groups of a cloud platform:

## Types of Cloud Platforms
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides fundamental compute, storage, and networking resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Examples include AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs, and Google Compute Engine.
  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a higher level of abstraction, providing a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure App Service.
  
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers fully managed software applications over the internet, typically on a subscription basis. While not a "platform" in the traditional sense, it often relies on underlying cloud platforms to operate. Examples include Salesforce, Office 365, and Google Workspace.

## Purpose and Benefits of a Cloud Platform
