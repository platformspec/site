# Cloud Platforms

## Definition
A "Cloud Platform" refers to a comprehensive set of cloud-based services, tools, and infrastructure that allows organizations to develop, deploy, manage, and scale applications and services in the cloud. It provides a foundational environment that abstracts much of the complexity of managing physical hardware, networking, and data centers, enabling users to focus on building and running their applications.

A "Cloud Platform" is essentially the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, providing the tools, services, and resources necessary to develop, deploy, and manage applications in a scalable, flexible, and efficient manner. It abstracts the complexities of traditional IT management, enabling organizations to focus on innovation, agility, and delivering value to their customers.

Quickly and often "Cloud Platforms" become quite intricate and complicated as the organization expands its software based services.
