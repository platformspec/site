# Introduction

The Platform Specification is a standardized, community-driven framework designed to simplify and unify the process of defining, building, and managing cloud platforms. It addresses inefficiencies and challenges commonly encountered in platform management by providing a clear, structured approach for specifying cloud platforms across diverse environments and infrastructures. This specification ensures consistency, repeatability, and transparency for platform engineering teams and organizations working in cloud-native ecosystems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Platform Specification is to establish a common language and structure for defining cloud platforms. It ensures that all components—whether they relate to infrastructure, services, policies, or developer enablement—are consistently and comprehensively described. This helps platform engineers and organizations to deploy, maintain, and scale cloud platforms in a unified and efficient way, reducing errors and speeding up deployment cycles.

The specification also fosters collaboration between teams by providing a shared understanding of platform requirements and configurations. By using a community-driven approach, the specification evolves with industry trends and innovations, ensuring that cloud platforms are built on modern, best-practice foundations.

## Conventions

The Platform Specification follows several key conventions to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of use across all environments:

- **Declarative Approach**: All components and configurations are described declaratively, allowing for clear intent and ease of version control.
- **YAML Format**: The specification uses YAML for all files to ensure readability, ease of use, and support for hierarchical data structures.
- **Modular Design**: The specification encourages modularity, enabling reusable definitions for common platform components and configurations.
- **Extensibility**: While the core specification is designed to be comprehensive, it is also flexible, allowing for extensions to accommodate specific requirements and customizations.
- **Cloud Agnostic**: While specific cloud provider features can be defined, the specification remains cloud-agnostic at its core, ensuring it can be applied to any infrastructure, whether on-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud.

## Layout

The Platform Specification is organized into several sections, each representing a distinct aspect (the [six key pillars](../background/key-pillars)) of a cloud platform. These sections provide a structured way to capture all necessary details for platform creation and management:

- **Infrastructure**: Captures details related to cloud providers, environments, and credentials required to set up and manage the underlying platform infrastructure.
- **Compute & Networks**: Describes the platform’s compute, networking components, clusters, and related managed services.
- **Policies**: Defines cost management, logging, scaling, and other operational policies critical to the platform's functionality and governance.
- **Security & Compliance**: Ensures security configurations, including access control, identity management, and compliance-related requirements, are well-defined.
- **Developer Enablement**: Encompasses services that accelerate developer productivity, such as application APIs, serverless services, and more.
- **Observability & Performance**: Provides tools and configurations for monitoring, alerting, and performance tuning.

Each section is designed to be self-contained yet interoperable, allowing teams to mix and match configurations based on their specific requirements.

## Formats

The Platform Specification uses YAML as its foundational format due to its readability, flexibility, and widespread adoption within the cloud-native community. The specification adheres to the following formatting principles:

- **Indentation**: YAML’s nested structure relies on consistent indentation using spaces (2 or 4 spaces), ensuring clarity and preventing formatting issues.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: All platform components are defined as key-value pairs, where keys represent the configuration aspect and values capture the details.
- **Lists**: Where multiple entries are required (e.g., multiple environments, services), lists are used for organization and readability.
- **References**: The specification allows for external references to modularized components, enabling reuse of standard definitions across platforms.

THe Platform Specification can be transformed into JSON as YAML and JSON are interchangable; however one loses the ability to provide in-line comments and documentation.

The use of these formats ensures that platforms are easy to define, extend, and automate, with clear human-readable descriptions that are machine-friendly for programmatic management.
