# The Specification
## Introduction
The Platform Specification defines a structured, declarative framework for describing and managing cloud-native platforms. It is designed to standardize how platforms are represented, making it easier for teams to define, build, and operate consistent, scalable, and secure platforms across diverse environments. By capturing the essential components, configurations, and policies of a platform in a clear and organized format, the specification serves as the foundation for both human and automated processes in platform engineering.

The specification uses a YAML or JSON structure modeled on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), ensuring compatibility with cloud-native ecosystems. Each instance of the specification includes well-defined fields and sections that describe the platform's infrastructure, services, policies, and operational guidelines. This approach allows platform teams to capture the desired state of their platform while maintaining flexibility in implementation and tooling.

While the Platform Specification is modeled on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to leverage a familiar, structured, and extensible format, it is not tied to Kubernetes clusters or their runtime environments. The specification is simply a declarative framework written in YAML or JSON, intended to be stored in files and parsed by any program or tool that supports these formats. There is no requirement to leverage or install the objects into a Kubernetes cluster. Instead, the specification serves as a standalone document that can be used to define platform requirements, generate configurations, or drive orchestration workflows across any infrastructure or tooling ecosystem. This decoupled design ensures maximum flexibility and accessibility for diverse use cases and environments.

> [!WARNING]
> The specification is still a work in process and is being actively designed.
>
> Expect active/frequent changes.
>
> Modifications to the spec will be highlighted on the [news](../../news) page accordingly.

The six domains that The Platform Specification captures, to fully define a platform, irrespective of its type (Infrastructure Platform, Developer Platform, Services Platform), are as follows:

**1. Infrastructure**
   - Core physical and virtual resources required to support the platform, including:
     - **Providers**: Cloud providers, on-premises infrastructure.
     - **Environments**: Staging, production, etc.
     - **Credentials and Access**: Authentication details for providers.
     - **Machine Images**: AMIs, VM templates, etc.
     - **Storage and Persistence**: Volumes, S3 buckets, databases.

**2. Compute & Networks**
   - Compute and networking resources needed for workloads, covering:
     - **Servers and Nodes**: Virtual machines, bare-metal servers, etc.
     - **Kubernetes Clusters**: Managed (EKS, GKE) or self-hosted.
     - **Networking Configurations**: VPCs, subnets, security groups, firewalls.
     - **Managed Services**: Hosted databases, message queues, and similar services.

**3. Policies**
   - Rules and guidelines to control platform operations and behaviors:
     - **Cost Management**: Budgeting, quotas, alerts.
     - **Scaling Policies**: Auto-scaling, load balancing.
     - **Disaster Recovery**: Backups, replication, and restoration.
     - **Security**: Identity and access management (IAM), encryption.
     - **Governance**: Compliance standards (SOC2, GDPR).

**4. Governance & Compliance**
   - Ensures platform operation adheres to organizational and regulatory requirements:
     - **Auditing**: Logs of access and operations.
     - **Compliance Standards**: Policies aligned to ISO, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.
     - **Identity & Access**: RBAC, multi-factor authentication.
     - **Data Protection**: Retention policies, secure data handling.

**5. Developer Services & Enablement**
   - Tools and services that empower developers to build, test, and deploy applications:
     - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD.
     - **Application Hosting**: Serverless functions, app containers.
     - **API Management**: API gateways, service meshes.
     - **Dev Tools**: IDE integrations, debugging tools.
     - **Platform SDKs**: Libraries for interacting with platform resources.

**6. Monitoring and Insights**
   - Systems for monitoring, analyzing, and improving platform performance:
     - **Metrics and Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch.
     - **Cost Accounting**: Kubecost, Opencost, Cloudhealth, etc.
     - **Logging**: Log aggregation, search, and analysis tools.

## Document Structure
The Platform Specification has embraced a modern approach to defining and managing your platforms using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This allows us to leverage the power and flexibility of Kubernetes while providing a structured and declarative way to represent platform components.

The Platform Specification defines several core API kinds, each representing a distinct element within your platform:

![PlatformSpecMindMap (light)](./PlatformSpecMindMap-light.drawio.png){.light-only}
![PlatformSpecMindMap (dark)](./PlatformSpecMindMap-dark.drawio.png){.dark-only}

Each api kind represents a fundamental aspect of the platform:

  * **Platform:** Represents the overarching blueprint for your entire platform. It encompasses high-level configurations, policies, and references to other resources like credentials, providers, and environments, and more.
  * **Credential:** Defines reference parameters for locations to sensitive information required for connecting to various services (e.g., API keys, passwords) and interacting with Providers.
  * **Provider:** Defines the specific provider or service used for managing parts of your Platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Each provider configuration includes details about any specific settings required for that provider.
  * **Environment:** Represents a distinct operational environment for your platform (e.g., development, testing, production). Environments often have unique configurations, resource constraints, or access policies.
  * **Cluster:** Defines a cluster within your platform. Clusters can be of many orchestration engines, from Kubernetes to Fargate to Nomad, or more.  This includes details about the cluster's size, network configuration, node types, and other relevant settings.
  * **Server:** Specifies individual servers or virtual machines deployed within your platform. Servers are associated with specific environments, providers, and software configurations.
  * **SoftwareGroup:** Represents a collection of software packages to be installed into your cluster(s) or server(s). Software Groups define installation methods, dependencies, and configuration settings for these packages.
  * **Image:** Defines machine or container images used within your platform, often associated with Clusters and Servers.
  * **SoftwarePackage:** Represents a single software package to be installed as part of a SoftwareGroup. It includes details about the package name, version, source repository, dependencies, and installation instructions.
  * **Policy:** Defines rules and constraints that apply to various aspects of your platform, such as resource usage, security configurations, or deployment workflows. Policies can enforce best practices, ensure compliance with regulations, or automate specific actions based on predefined conditions.

The Platform Specification structure promotes a modular and organized approach to defining complex cloud platforms, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and consistency across different environments and deployments.

Letâ€™s walk through these API kinds:
