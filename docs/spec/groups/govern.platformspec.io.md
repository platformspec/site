# API Group: govern.platformspec.io
The `govern.platformspec.io` API Group defines how teams, users, and organizations interact with the platform, establishing the rules, policies, and structures that guide platform usage and access.  It provides a framework for team management, resource allocation, cost visibility, and access control, ensuring that the platform operates efficiently, securely, and within organizational boundaries.

By enforcing governance policies and operational constraints, `govern.platformspec.io` enables organizations to manage platform users, roles, and permissions at scale.  This ensures that platform ownership, responsibility, and resource consumption are well-defined, transparent, and aligned with business objectives.
