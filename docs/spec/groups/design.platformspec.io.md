# API Group: design.platformspec.io
The `design.platformspec.io` API Group captures the architectural intent and high-level structure of a platform.  It enables platform teams to codify platform blueprints, define core structures, and establish best practices before infrastructure is provisioned.

This group ensures that platforms are designed with scalability, resilience, and security in mind by providing a declarative approach to planning infrastructure, networking, and service topologies.  By standardizing platform design at the outset, `design.platformspec.io` helps organizations build consistent, repeatable, and future-proof platforms.
