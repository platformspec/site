# API Group: sdk.platformspec.io
The `sdk.platformspec.io` API Group provides programmatic access, automation, and tooling to interact with the Platform Specification.  It ensures that the specification is machine-readable, extensible, and adaptable to different environments and workflows.

By offering APIs, SDKs, validation rules, and transformation utilities, `sdk.platformspec.io` allows platform teams to automate platform operations, integrate with external tools, and enforce best practices through code.  This group ensures that the Platform Specification is not just a static document, but an interactive and extensible framework for managing cloud platforms.

Think of this as an API Group with Kinds that define and aide in integrating with the Platform Specification itself.
