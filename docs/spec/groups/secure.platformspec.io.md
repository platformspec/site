# API Group: secure.platformspec.io
The `secure.platformspec.io` API Group defines the security, compliance, and governance controls necessary to protect the platform and its workloads.  It provides a structured approach to enforcing access policies, securing sensitive data, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks.

By embedding security best practices into platform operations, `secure.platformspec.io` enables organizations to proactively mitigate risks, maintain auditability, and uphold trust.  This group ensures that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of how the platform is built, deployed, and operated.

## Overview
| Kind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Policy](#policy) | A generic policy definition with a type field to classify policies (e.g., SecurityPolicy, AuditPolicy, IAMPolicy, DataProtectionPolicy). |
| [AccessControlPolicy](#accesscontrolpolicy) | Defines granular access control rules that extend beyond RBAC, such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) and custom access conditions. |
| [NetworkPolicy](#networkpolicy) | Specifies access control rules governing traffic flow between workloads, internal services, and external endpoints. |
| [ComplianceStandard](#compliancestandard) | Captures regulatory and compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA, GDPR) that the platform must adhere to. |
| [AuditPolicy](#auditpolicy) | Specifies logging, auditing, and monitoring rules for security events and compliance enforcement. |
| [IncidentResponsePlan](#incidentresponseplan) | Outlines response steps, triggers, and responsibilities for handling security incidents and breaches. |

## Upcoming/TBD
The following is a list of Kinds that are candidates to be defined in the future.  If you have a suggestion for a Kind that should be defined, please open an issue or pull request.

| Kind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [RBACPolicy](#rbacpolicy) | Defines strict role-based access control (RBAC) rules for platform users, teams, and services. |
| [SecretManagement](#secretmanagement) | Enforces policies on how sensitive platform secrets (e.g., API keys, tokens, certificates) are stored, accessed, and rotated. |
| [DataProtectionPolicy](#dataprotectionpolicy) | Defines encryption, data retention, access control, and deletion policies for handling sensitive data. |
| [RuntimeSecurityPolicy](#runtimesecuritypolicy) | Defines real-time security monitoring, anomaly detection, and intrusion detection policies for active workloads. |
| [EncryptionPolicy](#encryptionpolicy) | Specifies encryption requirements for data at rest, in transit, and in use across the platform. |
| [ThreatModel](#threatmodel) | Documents identified risks, attack surfaces, potential threats, and mitigation strategies within the platform. |
| [CertificatePolicy](#certificatepolicy) | Manages TLS/SSL certificates, key rotation policies, and validation rules for securing platform communications. |
| [IAMPolicy](#iampolicy) | Defines identity and access management (IAM) rules for platform users, service accounts, and automation processes. |
| [APIAccessPolicy](#apiaccesspolicy) | Specifies rules governing access control for platform APIs, including authentication mechanisms and rate limiting. |
| [WorkloadSecurityPolicy](#workloadsecuritypolicy) | Defines workload-specific security measures, including workload identity, sandboxing, and runtime constraints. |
| [SupplyChainSecurityPolicy](#supplychainsecuritypolicy) | Enforces security requirements for the platformâ€™s software supply chain, including signed images and verified dependencies. |
| [KeyManagementPolicy](#keymanagementpolicy) | Defines encryption key lifecycle management, rotation strategies, and key escrow policies. |
| [ComplianceAssessment](#complianceassessment) | Defines automated compliance scanning, reporting, and enforcement mechanisms. |
| [SecurityMonitoringRule](#securitymonitoringrule) | Specifies real-time security monitoring and alerting thresholds for suspicious activities. |
| [DDoSProtectionPolicy](#ddosprotectionpolicy) | Establishes protections against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, including rate limiting and firewall rules. |
