# Getting Started with the Platform Specification

The Platform Specification is a [YAML](https://yaml.org)-based, community-driven standard for defining cloud platforms. It provides a structured, consistent approach to specifying all the key components, configurations, and policies needed to deploy and manage a cloud platform across multiple environments. This specification is designed to improve the efficiency of platform management by ensuring clarity, modularity, and scalability from the start.
Introduction to YAML in the Platform Specification

The Platform Specification uses [YAML](https://yaml.org) as the format for defining platform components. YAML is chosen for its human-readable syntax and ability to represent complex data structures easily. In this specification, YAML files are used to define various aspects of the platform, such as infrastructure, compute, policies, and more.

Hereâ€™s an example of the structure for the Platform Specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: base.platformspec.io/v1alpha1
kind: Platform
metadata:
  name: example
