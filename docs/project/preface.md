# Preface

Welcome to the Platform Specification project. This is an exciting and ambitious initiative aimed at creating a standardized approach to defining cloud platforms through a structured, YAML/JSON-based specification. As cloud platform engineering continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the need for consistency, scalability, and efficiency has never been more important. This project seeks to address those needs by providing a unified framework for platform development and management across diverse environments.

The Platform Specification is in its early stages and is rapidly evolving. We are at the very beginning of a long and collaborative journey to define what we believe will become a cornerstone of cloud-native architecture. Currently in version `v1alpha1`, the specification is a work in progress, and we are constantly refining its scope, structure, and components based on both ongoing internal work and community feedback.

As an open project, we deeply value input from the cloud platform community. Whether you are an architect, engineer, developer, or cloud enthusiast, your experience and insights are *crucial* in shaping the future of this specification. We welcome feedback on any aspect of the specification—whether it’s clarifying certain sections, proposing new features, or suggesting improvements to existing ones.

Additionally, contributions to the specification itself are encouraged. We envision this project as a community-driven effort that will grow and adapt alongside the ever-changing needs of cloud platform engineering. By participating, you can help us ensure that this framework remains relevant, practical, and inclusive of the diverse challenges faced by modern platforms.

Thank you for taking part in this journey with us. We look forward to your ideas, contributions, and collaboration as we continue to build and evolve the Platform Specification.
