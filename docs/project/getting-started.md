# Getting Started with The Platform Specification
The Platform Specification originally started as a solution to working on automation to build fully functional, Kubernetes based platforms that reside in multiple IaaS providers, leverage many external SaaS services, and manage several types of workloads (from ML/AI, to IoT and Fintech and general purpose SaaS).

It was created as a set of standard input values to Helm charts (ie structure around `values.yaml`), who were then responsible for the provisioning and lifecycle management of said platforms.  If you've ever worked with Helm, you know that it's a great tool for templating and managing Kubernetes resources, but it's not a great tool for managing neither the lifecycle of a platform, nor the intricate and custom design requirements.

The Platform Specification was created to fill that gap.

## In a Nutshell: What is the Platform Specification?
The Platform Specification is an open, declarative standard for describing Cloud Native Platforms‚Äîthose built on Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure.

It allows teams to codify every component of their platform‚Äîfrom infrastructure providers and clusters to policies, developer services, and observability‚Äîusing a consistent, portable YAML format. The specification is implemented as a set of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), supported by tooling to validate, orchestrate, and manage entire platforms declaratively.

However, The Platform Specification is more than just a schema ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complete framework for designing, defining, and driving cloud-native platforms.

The project consists of four core parts:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ‚úèÔ∏è **Standardized API Resources (CRDs)** | A well-structured set of Custom Resource Definitions, grouped into logical API domains (e.g. `core.platformspec.io`, `design.platformspec.io`, `secure.platformspec.io`, etc.). These define all the components that make up a modern platform‚Äîfrom clusters and providers to policies, observability, developer services, and more. |
| üõ†Ô∏è **SDKs for Real-World Usage** | Official SDKs in Golang, Python, Java, and KCL allow you to work with the spec programmatically. These SDKs include models for all Platform Specification resources, making it easy to generate, validate, or manipulate them in code or automation pipelines. |
| üìú **Blueprints and** üèóÔ∏è **Builders (Realization Layer)** | Once you define your platform, Blueprints and Builders turn that definition into reality. These are implementation engines that translate Platform Specification resources into actual cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Crossplane, and others. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Platform Operators (Runtime Automation)** | Coming soon: Platform Operators that bridge the gap between your platform definitions and their realization. These operators manage lifecycles, dependencies, reconciliation, and binding between Platform Specification resources and their corresponding Blueprints + Builders. |

## Why Does This Matter?

See the [Preface](/docs/project/preface) for a more detailed explanation.

## Who Is It For?

- **Platform Engineering Teams:**  Defining and operating internal platforms and infrastructure with consistency and clarity.
- **SREs and DevOps Engineers:**  Ensuring repeatability, automation, and reliability across clusters and environments.
- **Cloud Architects:**  Designing scalable, multi-region, and multi-cloud systems with a structured representation.
- **Tool Builders and Integrators:**  Creating automation and visualization tools with a standard API for interacting with platform resources.
- **Executives & Technical Leadership:**  Seeking transparency and standardization across teams and initiatives through a shared language and structure.
- **Security Architects:**  Codifying security, compliance, and governance policies directly into platform definitions.
- **Developers & Workload Operators:**  Understanding and accessing platform capabilities through a well-defined service contract.

## How do I use it?

::: danger Not ready
The Platform Specification is still in development and not yet ready for full use.

Please follow the [News](/docs/project/news) page for updates on the project's progress.

Please visit the [Roadmap](/docs/project/roadmap) for a detailed timeline of upcoming features and releases.

We are actively working on this and will update this page as soon as it is ready.
:::

### 1. Install the CRDs
Install the Platform Specification CRDs into your Kubernetes Cluster

See the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/platformspec) for the latest releases and installation instructions.

::: warning Work in Progress
Please note that the CRDs are still being developed and are not yet ready for full installation into a cluster.  We are actively working on this and will update this page as soon as they are ready.
:::

### 2. Define your Platform
Create a YAML structured file (e.g. `platform.yaml`) describing infrastructure, services, and policies.

::: warning Work in Progress
This is presently a manual process.  Tooling for designing and building platforms is under active development.  Reference designs and examples will be provided as soon as they are available.
:::

### 3. Select your Operator
Install and configure your Platform Specification operator to manage your platform.

::: warning Work in Progress
Operators written in Java and in Python are in development.  Details will be provided as soon as they are available.
:::

### 4. Realize your Platform
Use Blueprints and their leveraged/dependent  Builders to turn your platform definition into real cloud infrastructure.

::: warning Work in Progress
Blueprints and Builders are under active development.  Details will be provided as soon as they are available.
:::

### 5. Manage your Platform
Use Platform Operators to automate the lifecycle of your platform, ensuring consistency and reliability.

### Further Details
Full details are provided on the [Workflow and Usage](/docs/spec/workflow-and-usage) page.
