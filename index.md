features:
  # - title: Comprehensive Platform Coverage
  #   details: From <strong>Infrastructure & Operations</strong> to <strong>Application Development</strong> and <strong>Services Control Planes</strong>, Platform Spec defines standards for all major platform types.
  # - title: Enhanced Collaboration
  #   details: Streamline teamwork with a single, transparent configuration file, enabling platform engineers, developers, and operations teams to work in sync.
  # - title: Faster Time to Market
  #   details: Accelerate platform deployment and reduce onboarding time with a clear, structured framework that empowers new team members quickly.
  # - title: Collaborative Platform Design
  #   details: Use the spec CRDs to manifest your layout in workshops. Help other teams engage into the discussion by using a well defined catalog.  Seemlessly continue with the machine readable results.
  # - title: Standardized Tool Integration
  #   details: Use platformspec as a common abstraction layer between arbitraty tools of your platform. Leverage client SDKs for cleaner integrations.
  # - title: Learn from comparable platform designs
  #   details: Make platform topologies comparable, easier to understand and learn from other projects to improve.
  # - title: What is it?
  #   details: The Platform Specification is an open, YAML-based standard for defining modern cloud platforms. It lets you describe infrastructure, services, policies, and developer tools—across any cloud or Kubernetes environment.
  # - title: Why it matters
  #   details: <ul><li>&bullet; Inconsistent environments</li><li>&bullet; Tribal knowledge and fragile automation</li><li>&bullet; Runaway costs and misconfigured services</li></ul>
  # - title: Comprehensive Coverage
  #   details: From <strong>Infrastructure & Operations</strong> to <strong>Application Development</strong> and <strong>Services Control Planes</strong>, Platform Spec defines standards for all major platform types.
  - title: 📦 Modular Structure
    details: Define only what you need—Infrastructure, Compute, Policies, and more—in isolated, reusable sections.
    linkText: See the API groups
    link: /docs/spec/spec#api-groups
  - title: ✏️ Declarative and Git-Friendly
