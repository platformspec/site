## Overview

The Platform Specification is designed to help platform engineers, infrastructure architects, and DevOps teams define and manage cloud platforms efficiently. By providing a common structure, this specification makes it easier to deploy platforms across different cloud providers and environments. The documentation is built using [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/), and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Website

The official documentation for the Platform Specification is generated statically using [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) and can be found at https://platformspec.io.

## Getting Started

The website and documentation is written using [Vitepress :: Vite & Vue Powered Static Site Generator - Markdown to Beautiful Docs in Minutes](https://vitepress.dev).  Please see documentation on https://vitepress.dev for details.

You can work on the Platform Specification and its accompanying documentation locally by following the steps below.

### Using Docker

We recommend using Docker to avoid the need for setting up Node.js locally.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/platformspec/site.git platformspec/site
   cd platformspec/site
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   touch .env
   make build
   make run
   ```

3. **Access the Local Site:**
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the live version of the site locally.

### Using npm

Alternatively, you can use Node.js and npm for local development.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/platformspec/site.git platformspec/site
   cd platformspec/site
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

4. **Access the Local Site:**
   Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the site.

### Build the Site

To build the static HTML version of the site for production:

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

The output will be located in the `dist/` directory.
