::: info Major Updates
Much has progressed with The Platform Specification, as a result of some fantastic feedback from [Kubecon North America (Salt Lake City) 2024!](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)

Many and much thanks for the review and feedback goes out to (alphabetical):

  - Abby Bangser
  - Adam Otto
  - Adam Russak
  - Bruno Schaatsbergen
  - Colin Griffin
  - Craig Tracey
  - Erick de Carty

  - Lou Bichard
  - Myles Steinhauser
  - Piotr Szwed

The highlight of the changes to the specification and site are as follows:

  * **Kubernetes Structure:**  Specification has been restructured into a Kubernetes API/Kind style setup (with metadata, apiVersion, kind, etc...)
  * **Composability:**  Components of a Platform have been made composable, by breaking them out into multiple Kinds (such as Platform, Network, Environment, etc).
  * **Documentation:**  Major updates and refinement, discussing the various types of Platforms (from Infrastructure Platforms, to Developer Platforms, to Services ie Control Plane Platforms).

We have a new contributor to the project -- [Jens Saade](https://github.com/jenssaade) -- who has provided much needed review, fixes, and guidance.

Last but not least, we have our first [SDK for Java](https://github.com/verticle-io/platformspec-model-java), graciously authored by [Jens Saade](https://github.com/jenssaade)!
